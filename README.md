Interactive rating with micro animations
For this fun challenge I used gsap for the flipping card and also for the micro animation in the svg on the thank you-card. I basically broken up the svg in different groups with each a unique id to animate them.

## Known issues
After clicking one of the rating buttons, the hover-effect on the other buttons doesn't work as expected.
